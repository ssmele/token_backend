# token_backend
Backend that powered project token. Senior capstone project. Majority of backend python code was designed and implemented by me. Please disregard the HTML I did not design or implement those sections.

Most of the logic is within the /routes/*.py, and /models/*.py files. (I did not write the analytics.py file)

***
This project can be run in debug mode like any other flask app. ./python TOKER.py should do the trick.
