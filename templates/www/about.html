<br>
<b>Web Portal</b>: This is the location in which Issuers interact with the application. It is facilitated with a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap that were used construct the portal from scratch. This portal communicates with the RESTful web server api via HTTP requests in order to get user data, and initiate token deployment requests. Additionally, the analytics page allows Issuers to view statistics on their deployed tokens generated by collection activity.
<br>
<br>
<b>Mobile Application</b> (Android): The mobile application provides the necessary functionality for Collectors to interact with the Token system. Each of these interactions corresponds with one or more HTTP requests to the API that is used to query data and facilitate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The application was built from scratch using Swift in the Xcode IDE.
<br>
<br>
<b>Backend</b>: The backend operates as a central controller for the whole application. Publicly available web server technologies like Flask were used to build this backend from scratch. It consumes HTTP requests from the web portal, and mobile application to interact with the database or ethereum network if needed. The backend server dynamically writes solidity code that creates an issuerâ€™s smart contract as well as compiles that smart contract. The server also has a running instance of the Geth IPC client that opens up a node to the Ethereum network and provides an interface for interacting with contracts. The server maps objects on the Ethereum network to data stored in our central database to get token media, transfer ownership of a token from an issuer to a collector, provide token data to a collector, and many other desired interactions with a token.
<br>
<br>
<b>Database</b>: The database is the where we store any type of Collector user data such as their login, password, ethereum wallet keys, and various other attributes about their account. It is also the location where we store data on the issuers and the tokens that we have deployed on their behalf. The database was built using SQLite3, an existing database software solution, to facilitate this piece of our project. The database bridges the gab between the data stored on the Ethereum network and the application logic required by the mobile and web interfaces.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ethereum Network</b>: The Ethereum Network is used as the decentralized network that we deploy our token contracts to. This is an already existing network that provides the blockchain functionality, allowing tokens to be stored in a decentralized application. The backend server communicates with the network via the Ethereum protocol. The network not only stores our token contracts, but also various attributes about each token such as the issuer, what collection a token is apart of, and various media associated with each token. The backend server hosts an Ethereum node and communicates with via a hosted IPC client that can only be reached internally within our server.
