    <p>
        <br>
        <b>Web Portal</b>: This is the location in which Issuers will interact with the application. It will be
        facilitated with a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap that we will use to construct the
        portal from scratch. This portal will be communicating with the RESTful web server api via HTTP requests in
        order to get user data, and initiate token deployment requests. Additionally, an analytics page will allow
        Issuers to view statistics on their deployed tokens generated by collection activity.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Mobile App (iOS)</b>: The mobile apps provide the necessary functionality for Collectors to interact with the
        Token system. Each of these interactions will correspond with one or more HTTP requests to the API that are used
        to query data and facilitate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The app will be built from scratch using
        Swift in Xcode.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Backend</b>: The backend will operate as a central controller for the whole application. Publicly available
        web server technologies like Flask will be used to build this backend from scratch. It will consume HTTP
        requests from the web portal, and mobile apps to interact with the database or ethereum network if needed. The
        backend server will need to dynamically write solidity code that creates an issuerâ€™s smart contract as well as
        compile that smart contract. The server will also have a running instance of the Geth RPC client that opens up a
        node to the Ethereum network and provides an interface for interacting with contracts. This server will map
        objects on the Ethereum network to data stored in our central database to get token media, transfer ownership of
        a token from an issuer to a collector, provide token data to a collector, and any other desired interactions
        with a token.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Database</b>: The database will be the location we store any type of collector/issuer user data such as their
        login, password, ethereum wallet keys, and various other attributes about their account. It will also be the
        location where we store data on the issuers and the tokens that we have deployed on their behalf. We will be
        using sqlite, an existing database software solution, to facilitate this piece of our project.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Ethereum Network</b>: The Ethereum Network will be used as the decentralized network we will be deploying our
        token contracts to. This is an already existing network that we will be communicating with to perform the
        necessary actions we want. The backend server will communicate with the network via the Ethereum protocol. The
        network will not only store our token contract but also various attributes about each token such as the issuer,
        what collection a token is apart of, and various media associated with each token.
